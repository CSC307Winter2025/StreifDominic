      <p>Developed multi-instrument controller software using an Arduino microcontroller - controller reads analog input signals for acceleration and pressure from a piezo-electric sensor attached to a drum membrane, converts the signals to control acceleration and speed of a stepper motor to strum a guitar concurrently. Developed a tailored NFC reader application for android devices (Kotlin) designed for the purpose of enhancing user authentication within REST API databases, ensuring a secure data access experience. Conducted in-depth analysis of Bluetooth data traffic to ascertain the operational characteristics of imitative technology, subsequently employing reverse engineering methodologies to harness and exploit inherent functionalities, which would eventually be used to settle a legal dispute.</p>
